# Recession Investment Strategy
![banner with stock market graphic, title of notebook and description of notebook ](images/0.png)


This is a multi-function jupyter lab notebook (stored as **Recession_Investment_Strategy.ipynb**) that compares investment returns from the previous four recessions across multiple indexes. As we enter a recession in 2022 it is a pertinent time to look at previous recessions to plan for the future. In this notebook we hope to answer the following questions:

* Which investment sectors performed the best in each recession period?
* Does the current market resemble any of the recession periods analyzed? 
* What part of the recession are we in, are we in the middle, bottom or on our way to recovery?
* Which investment sector is recommended to invest in based on best performance (return and speed) after the recession year end?
* Looking forward to 2023 (recession) should we adjust our investment strategy?
